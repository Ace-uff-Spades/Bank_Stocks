# Bank_Stocks
**A Data Analysis and Visualization Project**


This project mainly focuses on the usage of the following libraries. 
**Pandas**
**NumPy**
**Matplotlib**
**Seaborn**
**Plotly**
**Cufflinks**


The visualizations are best seen when run in Jupyter Notebooks. Thus you can download the .ipynb file, and run it through jupyter notebooks. The file takes you through my analysis, and techniques I used to graph, sort, and manipulate data on the 6 biggest investment banks today.
